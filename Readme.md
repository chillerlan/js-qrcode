# Auto generated API documentation

The API documentation can be auto generated with [jsdoc](https://github.com/jsdoc/jsdoc). 
There is an [online version available](https://chillerlan.github.io/js-qrcode/) via the [gh-pages branch](https://github.com/chillerlan/js-qrcode/tree/gh-pages) that is [automatically deployed](https://github.com/chillerlan/js-qrcode/deployments) on each push to main.

Locally created docs will appear in this directory. If you'd like to create local docs, please follow these steps:

- run `npm run jsdoc`
- open [index.html](./index.html) in a browser
- profit!
